This is a generalized EDA document for quickly working up biologging deployments returned from CATS tags on White Sharks.  
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
source("tag_fxns.R")
library(here)
set_here("/Volumes/Avalon")

#convert data read in to a fxn in tag_fxns.R
#how to select field?  

load.in2 <- function(dir, SI = T){
  #more robust load in fxn for identifying files in dir & loading in select fields w/ fread
  dd <- ifelse(isTRUE(SI), 
               params$deployID
               file.path(dir, "SI_*")
}
dir <- "/Volumes/Avalon"  
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
